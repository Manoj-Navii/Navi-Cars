            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>The Mahindra Thar CRDe 4x4 is a rugged, all-terrain vehicle that embodies the spirit of adventure and off-road driving. <br>With its 2.5-liter CRDe engine, it offers a refined yet powerful performance, although it lacks the smoothness and quietness of modern cars. <br>The vehicle features a four-wheel drive system and has shown impressive articulation and traction, making it a favorite among off-road enthusiasts. <br>However, it lacks basic comforts such as a hard top, and the interior quality is not up to international standards. <br>The ride quality and handling have been improved with the use of 15-inch tyres, but they still have room for enhancement. <br>The Thar CRDe 4x4 is ideal for those who value its classic look, strong metal body, and off-road capabilities over everyday comfort and refinement.</p>
